# Angular Refresher

## Property Binding

- Uses square brackets [] - bind to properties to our own components or built in elements

## Event Binding 

- Uses parenteses () - Bind to native events, or our own events

## String Interpolation

- Uses {{}} - can be used anywhere text is expected

## Two Way Binding

- Uses [()] - on input elements, which allows us to get the current value, and also write to it, hence two way.
